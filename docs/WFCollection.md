# WFCollection

``` swift
public struct WFCollection 
```

## Inheritance

`Decodable`

## Initializers

### `init(title:alias:)`

Creates a basic `WFCollection` object.

``` swift
public init(title: String, alias: String?) 
```

This initializer creates a bare-minimum `WFCollection` object for sending to the server; use the decoder-based
initializer to populate its other properties from the server response.

If no `alias` parameter is provided, one will be generated by the server.

#### Parameters

  - title: The title to give the Collection.
  - alias: The alias for the Collection.

### `init(from:)`

Creates a `WFCollection` object from the server response.

``` swift
public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws 
```

Primarily used by the `WFClient` to create a `WFCollection` object from the JSON returned by the server.

#### Parameters

  - decoder: The decoder to use for translating the server response to a Swift object.

#### Throws

Error thrown by the `try` attempt when decoding any given property.
