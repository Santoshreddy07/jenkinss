# WFPost

``` swift
public struct WFPost 
```

## Inheritance

`Decodable`

## Initializers

### `init(body:title:appearance:language:rtl:createdDate:)`

Creates a basic `WFPost` object.

``` swift
public init(
        body: String,
        title: String? = nil,
        appearance: String? = nil,
        language: String? = nil,
        rtl: Bool? = nil,
        createdDate: Date? = nil
    ) 
```

This initializer creates a bare-minimum `WFPost` object for sending to the server; use the decoder-based
initializer to populate its other properties from the server response.

Only the `body` parameter is required. If other properties are not provided, they will be generated by
the server.

#### Parameters

  - body: The body text for the post.
  - title: The title for the post.
  - appearance: The appearance for the post; one of `sans`, `serif`/`norm`, `wrap`, `mono`,  or `code`. Defaults to `serif`.
  - language: An ISO 639-1 language code.
  - rtl: Set to `true` to show content right-to-left.
  - createdDate: The published date for the post.

### `init(from:)`

Creates a `WFPost` object from the server response.

``` swift
public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws 
```

Primarily used by the `WFClient` to create a `WFPost` object from the JSON returned by the server.

#### Parameters

  - decoder: The decoder to use for translating the server response to a Swift object.

#### Throws

Error thrown by the `try` attempt when decoding any given property.
